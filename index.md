## Abel Dantas

<!-- ![A light-skinned man in his mid-30s with dark brown, slightly wavy hair and a well-groomed beard stands against a neutral gray background. His eyes are deep-set and dark, and he has a confident, warm smile. He is wearing a plain white T-shirt and has a relaxed posture with his arms crossed. His muscular arms and lightly tanned skin suggest an active lifestyle. His expression is approachable and self-assured, conveying a sense of quiet confidence (AI generated).](assets/abel-dantas.jpg) -->

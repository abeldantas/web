    <section>
        <p>I'm a founder and engineer focused on building systems that work without centralized coordination.</p>

        <p>Over the past decade, I've founded multiple organizations and led technical teams. I served as CTO of a blockchain gaming company for six years. Currently, I'm exploring how distributed ledgers and gamification can create verifiable ownership systems and coordination across organizations—with fashion retail as the application domain.</p>

        <p>I'm pursuing a PhD at University of Porto with Professor <a href="https://cbaquero.github.io/web/">Carlos Baquero</a> on Byzantine fault tolerance and distributed ledgers, with research interests in gamification. My work on CRDTs in peer-to-peer VR was published at PaPoC 2025 (ACM). I also teach as Guest Professor at IPVC and FEUP.</p>

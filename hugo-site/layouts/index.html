        <p>I'm an engineer and researcher focused on systems that work without centralized coordination and the mechanisms that drive engagement within them.<label for="photo" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" id="photo" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><img src="/web/assets/abel-dantas.jpg" alt="Abel Dantas" style="max-height: 500px; width: 100%;"><br>Photograph of me taken by my good friend <a href="https://joaopeixoto.pt/sobre">João Peixoto</a>, circa 2024.</span></p>

        <p>I'm a PhD candidate at University of Porto, working with Professor <a href="https://cbaquero.github.io/web/">Carlos Baquero</a> on Byzantine fault tolerance and distributed ledger systems. My research on CRDTs in peer-to-peer VR was published at PaPoC 2025 (ACM). I serve as Guest Professor at both IPVC and FEUP.</p>

        <p>My research interests span distributed ledgers, Byzantine fault tolerance, and gamification systems. I founded CTVC, northern Portugal's first tech cooperative—a decentralized structure for tech professionals. Over the past decade, I've led technical teams in gaming, blockchain infrastructure, and applied research.</p>

        <h2>Ventures &amp; Projects</h2>

        <h3>Xarp</h3>
        <p><strong>Co-Founder, Lead Researcher</strong> (Nov 2024–Present)</p>

       <p>Leading research exploring cross-retailer interoperability and engagement mechanics for fashion. The work combines distributed ledger technology for verified provenance with game design principles to drive sustainable shopping behaviors. Working in partnership with INESC TEC to develop smart mirror infrastructure and distributed systems for retail.<label for="xarp-role" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="xarp-role" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">The project emerged from CTVC, bridging my PhD research in Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed ledgers with a decade of experience in gaming. The research explores how distributed systems enable cross-retailer coordination without central authorities, and how gamification mechanics from digital games can transform physical retail experiences.</span></p>

        <h3>CTVC</h3>
        <p><strong>Chair of the Supervisory Board</strong> (2025–Present)<br>
        <strong>President</strong> (2021–2025)</p>

        <p>Founded a tech innovation center bringing together specialists in a collaborative structure.<label for="ctvc-role" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ctvc-role" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Viana had no working incubator, so we created an open ecosystem where researchers, developers and tech professionals share resources, knowledge and opportunities. I bootstrapped this young organization and currently focus on financial sustainability and developing <a href="https://sigo.ctvc.pt/">our internal management software</a>, exploring how engagement mechanics can improve collaborative workflows.</span> We function as a platform for R&amp;D collaboration and professional development.</p>

        <h3>FYX Gaming (formerly Kronoverse)</h3>
        <p><strong>Co-Founder &amp; CTO</strong> (2018–2024)</p>

        <p>Co-founded a blockchain gaming venture backed with over $6M in VC funding, leading engineering teams on projects exploring digital ownership and in-game economies. This work with distributed systems and engagement mechanics in gaming directly informs my current research in fashion retail and collaborative platforms.</p>
